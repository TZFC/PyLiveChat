# PyLiveChat
A Bilibili live chat client curated for streamers

Based on bili-live-api, a more frequently updated thus more stable method of connection (compared to blivechat). 
Provide convenient features frequently requested by streamers:
1. BV link 弹幕里的 BV 号可以直接点击
2. show @ between audience 显示用户之间互相@的对象
3. gift acknowledgment progress 谢礼物进度
4. temporary/timed ban/unban 定时禁言解禁
5. Red pocket receipiant list 红包得奖名单
6. Username Pinyin / translation 用户名拼音或翻译
7. Permanant Nickname for audience 永久用户昵称

performance & portability in mind, but not prioritized.
